AI-Powered Parking Space Detection System 

This project implements an AI-powered parking space detection system using YOLOv8, OpenCV, and Python. It detects and tracks parked vehicles in a video stream and highlights which parking spaces are occupied or free in real-time. This helps optimize urban parking and aids in smart city initiatives.

 Features
   Real-time vehicle detection using YOLOv8
   Custom-defined parking zones using mouse-drawn polylines
   AI-based detection of occupied vs empty spaces
   Dynamic frame processing for optimized performance
   Easy-to-use interface with visual feedback (green = free, red = occupied)
   Saves parking area layout using Pickle

    Python
    OpenCV
    YOLOv8 (ultralytics package)
    NumPy
    Pickle (for layout saving)
    Pandas (for frame data processing)

ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Install Thonny
   Download from https://thonny.org and install.

2. Create Project Folder
   Place these files in one folder:
   test1.py, test2.py, easy.mp4 (video), coco.txt (YOLO labels)

3. Install Required Libraries
   In Thonny:
   Go to Tools â†’ Manage packages
    
    Install:
    opencv-python
    numpy
    cvzone
    ultralytics 
    pandas
  Or use Shell:
    pip install opencv-python numpy cvzone ultralytics pandas
 4. Run test1.py
    Draw parking zones with the mouse.
    Press s to save, q to quit.

 5. Run test2.py
    Starts detection using YOLO.

    Shows occupied (red) and free (green) spaces.

    ðŸ“ˆ Future Enhancements
        Integrate with web dashboard for live monitoring.
        Store logs and analytics for parking trends.
        Add camera calibration for better zone alignment.
